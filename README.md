# Recommender-system-for-tourists
We have to build recommender system which recommends tourist travel locations based on his previous rated venues. Recommended engine is build on an observation that tourist always try to explore places which are nearby first. Letâ€™s consider an example for simplifying things. Bob arrived in Toronto and wants to visit top places in Toronto, If he starts exploring a particular neighbourhood, he wants to finish exploring all good places in that neighbourhood before moving to other neighbourhood. Keeping this in mind we have to recommend tourist a neighbourhood, with venues where he can visit. We will be using location data to get best spots in neighbourhood. For getting location data we will use Foursquare API.
